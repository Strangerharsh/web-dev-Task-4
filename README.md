I have created a movies website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in task-4.
Name of movie website is MovieGalaxy which shows the popular or trending movies on homepage with a search bar and website name/logo.
On hovering on any movies poster, it shows the Name, Overview, Rating and Description of movie.
It has search feature which shows the appropriate results on searhing.
